# Customer_Life_Value_Prediction_Celebal

Understanding customer behavior is essential for enhancing business strategies and improving retention. This project leverages **RFM analysis** to evaluate and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often they purchase  
- **Monetary (M):** How much money they spend

- Importance of RFM in Business Strategy

- Identify your most loyal and valuable customers
- Target inactive or lost customers with retention strategies
- Prioritize marketing campaigns based on customer value
- Boost overall customer engagement and ROI

RFM Segmentation

| Segment       | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Champions     | High R, F, and M values                      |
| Loyal         | Frequent buyers with good monetary value     |
| At Risk       | Low recency but used to be frequent spenders |
| New Customers | Recent but not frequent                      |
| Lost          | Not purchased for a long time                |


Used quantiles or K-means clustering to divide customers based on RFM scores

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis conducted in this project provided a data-driven approach to segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior. By leveraging RFM scores, we successfully identified key customer segments such as loyal customers, at-risk customers, and potential high-value customers. This segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies, enhances customer retention, and improves overall business decision-making.

Our analysis not only highlighted patterns in customer engagement and spending but also emphasized the value of clean data and well-defined metrics in deriving actionable insights. Moving forward, businesses can integrate RFM analysis into their customer relationship management (CRM) systems to personalize communication, optimize resource allocation, and drive revenue growth.
